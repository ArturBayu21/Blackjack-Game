# Blackjack-Game

This program allows users and computers to play Blackjack cards

How's the program work:
Once you run the program, it will ask you whether you want to play the game or not. if you type yes, the program will generate 2 random cards for you and 2 random cards for the computer. You can see your own card, calculate the value by yourself and get another card if you want. The computer has it's own algorithm to get another card. You only can see one of the computer's card, not all. if you decided to not get another card, the program will compare your card's value, with the computer value. The rules is pretty much the same with the black jack game in general.
